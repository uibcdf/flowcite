# What is FlowCite?

**FlowCite** is a workflow-aware citation and acknowledgement helper for scientific Python libraries.
It lets developers register potential citation items for functions and classes, and lets users collect
only the items that were actually used in a specific run.

> FlowCite — trace what you used, cite what matters.
