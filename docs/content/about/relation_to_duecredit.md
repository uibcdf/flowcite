# Relation to DueCredit

FlowCite is conceptually related to the DueCredit project: both aim to collect and report citations
based on actual usage of scientific software. FlowCite extends the idea with:

- explicit separation of **static registration** and **dynamic tracking per code path**;
- first-class support for non-publication items (repos, websites, datasets);
- optional dependency pattern for embedding in other libraries;
- planned interoperability with DueCredit via a compatibility layer.
