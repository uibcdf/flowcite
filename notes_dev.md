## Behavior expected

```python
import flowcite

flowcite.register_item(...)
flowcite.bind(...)
flowcite.scoped_usage(...)
print(flowcite.report())
```

compatibility

```python
from flowcite.contrib.duecredit_compat import export_duecredit_json, inject_into_duecredit
```

in a third-party library should work as intended:

```python
try:
    from flowcite import scoped_usage, track_item
except ImportError:
    def scoped_usage(target=None):
        def deco(fn):
            return fn
        return deco
    def track_item(*args, **kwargs):
        pass
```

## How to use it

```python
try:
    from flowcite import scoped_usage, track_item
except ImportError:
    # graceful fallbacks
    def scoped_usage(target=None):
        def deco(fn):
            return fn
        return deco

    def track_item(*args, **kwargs):
        pass
```
